<h1>Welcome to the Chicago InfoSec Events Calendar FAQ!</h1>

<p style="font-size:22px; ">The purpose of this effort is to coordinate scheduling for all the in-person security events in the Chicagoland area.<br />
<br />
If you would like to promote events, you can send a calendar invite ChicagoInfoSecEvents@gmail.com. FYI: The sending email will be visible on the public calendar.<br />
If you frequently host events (i.e. ISACA, BurbSec, ISSA, CSA, etc.), the organizers will reach out to you to see if you want direct access to manage the calendar. Direct access will be limited to people well-known by one of the organizers, since they could delete events created by other groups.<br />
<br />
<b>Events should include the following:</b><br />
- Event organizer<br />
- Event name<br />
- Date/time<br />
- Location<br />
- URL<br />
  * If the event is NOT open to everyone, please state by invitation (or members) only, and do NOT include a URL.<br />
- Please include the direct URL, and NOT a shortened URL (i.e. no bit.ly, goo.gl, etc. links)<br />
- Please don't include attachments<br />
<br />
<b>Only events that meet the following conditions should be posted:</b><br />
- Must be in person<br />
- Local to Chicago or hosted by an active member of the Chicago community<br />
- Discount codes appreciated, but not required<br />
<br />
