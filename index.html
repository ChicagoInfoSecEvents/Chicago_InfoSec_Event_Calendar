<b>Posting events:</b><br />
If you would like to promote events, you can send a calendar invite ChicagoInfoSecEvents@gmail.com. FYI: The sending email will be visible on the public calendar.<br />
Note: If you frequently host events (i.e. ISACA, BurbSec, ISSA, CSA, etc.), the calendar organizers will reach out and ask if you want calendar admin access to manage your events. Direct access will be limited to people well-known by one of the organizers, since they could delete events created by other groups.<br />
<br />
<b>Events should include the following:</b><br />
- Event organizer<br />
- Event name<br />
- Date/time<br />
- Location<br />
- URL<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;* If the event is NOT open to everyone, please state by invitation (or members) only, and do NOT include a URL.<br />
- Please include the direct URL, and NOT a shortened URL (i.e. no bit.ly, goo.gl, etc. links)<br />
- Please don't include attachments<br />
<br />
<b>Only events that meet the following conditions should be posted:</b><br />
- Must be in person<br />
- Local to Chicago or hosted by an active member of the Chicago community<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;* Exceptions will be made for big events that pull numerous attendees from the Chicago area such as RSA, BlackHat, etc.<br />
- Discount codes appreciated, but not required<br />
